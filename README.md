## Introduction & Project Vision

Welcome to **Stock Price Prediction - NIFTY 50**!

This repository serves as a comprehensive, end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting stock prices of NIFTY 50 companies using advanced deep learning techniques. My approach uniquely focuses on **Practical Financial Modeling**, **Real-World Implementation**, and **Production-Ready Deployment**, providing comprehensive insights through hands-on examples and real market datasets.

Whether you're a quantitative analyst, a data science enthusiast, or someone transitioning into algorithmic trading, this repository provides a clear, structured path to understanding stock price prediction using modern machine learning techniques.

### üéØ Focus Areas

- **Deep Learning Mastery**: Comprehensive implementation of LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models for time series forecasting
- **Technical Analysis**: Feature engineering with 20+ technical indicators including RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and more
- **Real-Time Data Pipeline**: Automated data acquisition from NSE using `yfinance` and `nsepy` libraries
- **Production Deployment**: Interactive Streamlit web application with real-time predictions and visualizations

# Load data and initialize model
data = load_nifty50_data('RELIANCE')
predictor = LSTMPredictor()

# Train model
predictor.fit(data)

# Make predictions
predictions = predictor.predict(horizon=30)  # 30-day forecast
```

### Run Streamlit Application
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

### Execute Complete Pipeline
```bash
# Data acquisition
python data/download_data.py --symbols NIFTY50 --period 5y
